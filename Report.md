# ANALYZING PROJECT CAMPAIGNS AT KICKSTARTER CROWDFUNDING SERVICE

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding service where more than 300,000 projects have been launched and over $2 billion has been raised successfully. Only a third of the projects made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. 
Objective of this study is to analyze a database of 4,114 projects from Kickstarter to present recommendations for organizations planning to initiate a campaign on Kickstarter to achieve success based on available parameters. 
## DATA
More than 300,000 projects have been launched on Kickstarter. Dataset includes characteristics of 4,114 project campaigns launched from May 2009 to March 2017 in 21 different countries in 13 different currencies with duration periods ranging from 1 day to 90 days. Dataset obtained from Kickstarter website in excel format. Dataset does not have any missing values. Data set includes only %1 of total projects.
## METHODS USED
Microsoft Excel is the only tool used for the analysis. 

The campaigns’ outcomes are analyzed based on the goals, parent categories, sub-categories, launch date. Additionally, campaigns’ outcomes are also analyzed based on the duration of conversion.
## ANALYSIS
We see that project campaigns with a goal of less than 1,000 (in currency) are more likely to be successful with a 71% success rate while the project campaigns with the goal of more than 50000 (in currency) more likely to be failed with a %59 failure rate (Figure 1).

The project campaigns launched in the month of May is more likely to be successful with a % 61 success rate). The project campaigns launched in the month of December is more likely to be failed with a %47 failure rate (Figure 2).

The project campaigns in the “music” parent category are more likely to be successful with a %77 success rate (Figure 3).

The project campaigns in the “rock”, “documentary”, “hardware”, “tabletop games”, “television”, “shorts”, “nonfiction”, “electronic music”, “classical music”, “pop”, “metal”, “radio & podcasts” sub-categories are more likely to be successful (%100 success rate). Sub-category of “Rock” has the highest number of campaigns launched (260) (Figure 4).

The project campaigns lasted for less than 20 days has a 71% success rate with 234 successful projects out of 328 (Figure 5).

## CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
Our sample data set only represents %1 of the population data. Given data set includes project campaigns launched in 21 countries, however, some countries have only 1 row of data available. Given data set is dominated by the data from 3 countries: US, Great Britain and Canada (3788 in total out of 4114). Small sample size is a limitation for our data.

Taking into account all the limitations mentioned above, the analyzed data tells us that a campaigner would have better success rate if he/she launches the project in May for less than 20 days, targets a goal less than $1000, and in one of these categories: “music, theater, film&video, photography”.

On the other hand, project campaigns were launched in 13 different currencies. Having more data with the more representation of the project campaigns from all countries would allow us to make a better analysis by region so that we can give recommendations to the campaigners located in different countries. Retrieving a data of the locations and demographic structure of donors would also help us improve our analysis.
